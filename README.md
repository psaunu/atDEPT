ASSIGNMENT
  Create a website or a web API on which you can search for movie trailers.
    -Use an API of an online movie database (e.g. IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes);
    -Use an API of an online video service (e.g. YouTube or Vimeo);
    -Create your own WebAPI as middleware to retrieve the results of both services and aggregate them;
    -Cache the aggregated data for performance;
    -Make the search as smart as you can;
    -Optionally create a web page that uses your own web API to search and show movies with trailers.
    -Use the development language of the vacancy you are applying for.
  TIPS
    -Follow industry standards when building your own API
    -Showing a lot of embedded videos on your web page increases page load time significantly
  BONUS
    -Add the option to share trailers on social networks;
    -Make sure your website is secure and super fast;
    -Create a contact form to request a trailer for a movie;

    Movie Tip:
      -chose IMDB-API from https://imdb-api.com/ because:
        it already implements the trailer functionality through Youtube, will be useful to debug.
